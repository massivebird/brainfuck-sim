# Brainfuck simulator

Simulates compiling and running a Brainfuck program.

Written in Rust ðŸ¦€ and inspired by [pretzelhammer's Too Many Brainfuck Compilers](https://github.com/pretzelhammer/rust-blog/blob/master/posts/too-many-brainfuck-compilers.md#what-is-brainfuck)!

> This is not a proper compiler! I am using Rust structures to simulate lower-level processes.
